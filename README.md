# Cupid Match
An iOS app using the Command Pattern to display a sample of OKCupid matches in a collection view

The **Command Pattern** is used to create an abstraction that will allow you to dequeue, configure, and handle the selection of cells without knowing their concrete types.

This is really useful if you want to create and represent different types of content in the same collection view.
